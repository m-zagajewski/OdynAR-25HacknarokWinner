# PosterPortals — Augmented Reality Poster Viewer

🏆 **1st Place Winner** at **Hacknarok Hackathon** in the **Mobile Augmented Reality** category! 🚀

Pierwsze zetknięcie z AR, wiele wyzwań, nieprzespana noc i debugowanie do ostatniej minuty – ale było warto!

Dziękuję mojemu zespołowi za wsparcie, mentorom za cenne wskazówki i organizatorom za tę przygodę.

## 🧠 Inspiration

We wanted to bring static posters to life using Augmented Reality.  
Imagine pointing your phone at a simple flyer and seeing it turn into an interactive digital portal.

With the rise of hybrid experiences in events, museums, and education, our goal was to make physical media more immersive and meaningful.

## ⚙️ What It Does

- Detects a physical image marker (like a poster or flyer)
- Overlays an interactive AR poster using RealityKit
- Allows the user to **tap** on the AR poster to view it fullscreen
- Creates a smooth and intuitive transition between physical and digital content

---

## 🛠️ How We Built It

- **Swift + SwiftUI** — for iOS interface
- **RealityKit + ARKit** — for image tracking and 3D rendering
- **Xcode** — development and testing

The app tracks a custom image from the user’s environment, places a 3D plane over it with the poster texture, and enables interaction via tap gestures.

---

## 🧱 Challenges We Faced

- Setting up image markers with the right size and physical dimensions
- Dynamically loading textures into RealityKit
- Managing ARView and SwiftUI gesture conflicts
- Integrating UIKit overlays within a SwiftUI AR flow

---

## 🏆 Accomplishments

- A fully functional AR experience with marker detection
- Clean, intuitive UI with real-time interactions
- A complete end-to-end AR prototype in under 24 hours!
- Our first experience with RealityKit — and a winning one!

---

## 📚 What We Learned

- ARKit and RealityKit image tracking basics
- Transform hierarchies and working with entities in AR
- UIKit + SwiftUI integration in AR projects
- Debugging real-world AR challenges with digital tools

## 🚀 What’s Next for `PosterPortals` / `MAROdynAR`

- ✅ Support for multiple image markers
- ✅ Interactive poster sets with richer media
- 🎥 Add video, animations, and 3D objects
- 📲 Publish as a promotional or educational AR app
- ✨ Explore markerless and LiDAR-based enhancements
- 📈 Add analytics to track poster engagement
